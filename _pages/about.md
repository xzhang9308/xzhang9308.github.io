I am currently a Research Scientist in the Alibaba-NTU Global e-Sustainability CorpLab (ANGEL) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), 
working with Prof. <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html">Weisi Lin</a>. 
Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University (Mac), Canada from July 2022 to August 2024, 
supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZuQnEIgAAAAJ">Xiaolin Wu</a>.
I was also an assistant researcher at Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), 
supervised by Prof. <a href="https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14">Hongkai Xiong</a>.
I earned my PhD from SJTU in June 2022 and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Physics Basic Science from UESTC in 2015.

My current research interests focus on green and energy-efficient AI technologies that prioritize sustainable ecosystems and lifestyles. 
Previously, I concentrated on learning-based data compression techniques, particularly for visual data such as images, videos, point clouds, and light fields. 
Additionally, I am interested in core deep learning challenges, including domain generalization and visual reasoning.
