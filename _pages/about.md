I am currently a Research Scientist in the Alibaba-NTU Global e-Sustainability CorpLab (ANGEL) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), 
working with Prof [Weisi Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html). 
Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University, Canada from July 2022 to August 2024, 
supervised by Prof [Xiaolin Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZuQnEIgAAAAJ).  
I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in June 2022, and my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics Basic Science from  University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2015.

My current research focuses on Green AI, particularly on efficient model design, sustainable system architectures, and resource-aware compression techniques. In this line, I work on lightweight architectures, quantization, and compression methods to reduce energy, memory, and computational costs of large-scale models while maintaining strong performance.
Previously, my research centered on learning-based data compression for various visual modalities such as images and videos. I am also interested in broader challenges in deep learning, including domain generalization and visual reasoning.

<!-- I have published over 10 first-author papers in top AI journals and conferences, including T-PAMI, T-IP, NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV, and AAAI. -->
